[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Gold-ish/CA2.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Gold-ish/CA2)

Sprint one (Friday 13/3 - Monday 16/3): 
The API description must be almost (we are using an iterative process) complete and available as a page on your deployed project.
The SCRUM plan for the three mini-sprints must be available as a page on your deployed project. This can either be a copy of our suggestion below, or Sprint-1 as given below and your own plan for the remaining sprints if your “product owner” agrees (red students).
The CI-pipeline must be setup
Some of the Entity Classes and the Facade(s) must be ready with supplementing tests
Sprint two (Tuesday 17/3 - Wednesday 18/3):
Most of the Entity Classes should be ready
Sample data should be available in the dev-database
Some of the endpoints (as a minimum a GET, POST and PUT) must be ready with the corresponding DTO’s and integrations tests
Sprint three (Thursday 19/3- Sunday 22/3):
Complete the API (as much as you have time for)
Implement a simple SPA which as a minimum must have the ability to use some of your GET endpoints and at least one POST endpoint. Consider pages like:
Get all persons with a given hobby
Get all persons living in a given city (i.e. 2800 Lyngby)
Get the count of people with a given hobby
Get a list of all zip codes in Denmark
Get a list of companies with more than xx employes
Get all phone numbers of a person
Create a Person (with hobbies, phone, address etc.)
Edit a Person to change hobbies and phone number etc.
Complete documentation and prepare for your review presentation after the holiday
